# Suite, aka Staffjoy V1

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Staffjoy/suite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Staffjoy/suite) [![Moonlight contractors](https://www.moonlightwork.com/shields/flask.svg)](https://www.moonlightwork.com/for/flask?referredByUserID=1&referralProgram=maintainer&referrerName=Staffjoy)

[Staffjoy is shutting down](https://blog.staffjoy.com/staffjoy-is-shutting-down-39f7b5d66ef6#.ldsdqb1kp), so we are open-sourcing our code. This version of our V1, intended for on-demand companies and call centers, has been heavily modified so that Staffjoy customers may continue using the software. It is a full workforce management suite, including time off requests, compliance management, and clock-in. Workers can even clock in and claim shifts. If you're managing small businesses and want only basic schedulding with text message support, please use [Staffjoy V2](https://github.com/staffjoy/v2)

[API Documentation is available on staffjoy-suite.readme.io](https://staffjoy-suite.readme.io/).

## Required and Optional Services

### Cron

The `/api/v2/internal/cron/` endpoint must be triggered every 60 seconds. [We open-sourced our Cron microservice that does this](https://github.com/staffjoy/suite-cron), but consider just using a Jenkins job with:

```curl --user API_KEY: http://suite.local/api/v2/internal/cron/```

(*NOTE*: the trailing colon after the API key is required)

### Chomp

Required for calculating shifts from forecasts. [View Chomp's source code on github.com/staffjoy/chomp-decomposition](https://github.com/staffjoy/chomp-decomposition)

### Mobius

Mobius assigns workers to shifts, subject to constraints. [View Mobius's source code on github.com/staffjoy/mobius-assignment](https://github.com/staffjoy/mobius-assignment)

### How we deployed

* AWS elastic beanstalk to run the Docker containers ([here's our deploy script](https://gist.github.com/philipithomas/190de362654601da43a08f3dc63ce4eb))
* AWS RDS for MySQL
* AWS Elasticache for Redis
* Healthcheck `/health` endpoint to determine instance health
* Terminate SSL at load balancer
* Run Cloudflare upstream
* Run at least three production containers (N + 2) for redundancy
* Stream logs to [Papertrail](http://papertrailapp.com)
* Strict firewalling of Redis for security

### Notes

* It is suggested that you fork this repository if you are using it
* If you do not want anybody from the web signing up for your application and provisioning new organizations, modify `ALLOW_COMPANY_SIGNUPS` in `app/config.py`
* The Staffjoy mobile applications do not work with self-hosted applications.

## Development Setup

Prequisites:

* Install [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

Add your email to the file `user.txt`, e.g. if your email is *lenny@staffjoy.com*:

```
echo "lenny@staffjoy.com" > ./user.txt
```

This auto-registers you on first boot, and makes you an admin.

To boot a dev server for the first time, run:
```
make dev
```

The first time it launches, it will take a long time to download the required base images. After that, required packages and images will be cached. The app will be running at [suite.local](http://suite.local)

To quickly launch a dev server that has already been built, you can use this shortcut command from the project root:

```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant
make dev-server
```

Be advised that this does not update any required packages or recompile the less stylesheets, so please run ```make dev``` occasionally.

### Installing new packages

Add new dependencies to the end of `requirements.txt`, then run `make dev`. The dev server is booted, the dependencies are installed, then the boot script immediately runs `pip freeze` to update requirements.txt with the latest version number, and nested dependencies.

### Hard-resetting a dev server

If you run into issues or if you messed up your environment, you can delete its caches with `vagrant destroy -f`. Running `make dev` will take longer as the system re-fetches dependencies.

### Creating a sudo account in dev

After creating a Staffjoy account in your dev environt, use the commands below to access the shell:

```
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant
make shell
```

Now in the shell window, write and execute the following code:

```
print User.query.get_all() # To find users - don't do this in prod where there are lots of user :-)
u = User.query.get(<id>)
u.sudo = True
db.session.commit()
```

The id will correspond to the id of the user that you just created and will be visible in the URL bar


## Working with the Repo

### Environments

To access the current environment, use:

```
from flask import current_app
print current_app.config.get("ENV") # dev or prod - as defined in config.py.
# Note that stage is treated as prod except for the robots.txt
```

### Working with the database

**Dev** - uses MySQL just like production. To access it, run the following commands from the project root:

```
vagrant ssh
<wait for login>
cd /vagrant
mysql -u root -p
<enter the password "bacon">
use dev;
```

The development MySQL root password is ```bacon```.

#### Database Migrations Summary

1. Make a change to the model (by modifying app/models.py)
2. Generate a migration that spits out the changes that need to be made to the database with `make db-migrate`
3. Apply those generated changes with `make db-deploy`

*Note: Commit the migration files*

#### Dev

While your vagrant machine is running, SSH into the instance with `vagrant ssh`. Then in `/vagrant/`, run `make db-migrate` to generate a migration. To apply the database change, you can either run `make db-deploy`, or opt for a standard `make-dev`.

##### If this doesn't work

It's easier to wipe a database than try and do a rollback. Log into the Dev MySQL Instance and run this command to wipe it:

```
drop database dev;
create database dev;
```

Exit MySQL and now run `make db-deploy` to rebuild it. You will have to create a new sudo user with the Shell Context.

### Shell Context

You can run `python main.py shell` and interact directly with the app, users, etc.

e.g.
```
python manage.py shell
u = User()
u.password = 'cat'
u.password_hash # See hash
u.verify_password('cat')
u.verify_password('dog')
db.session.commit()
```

This is useful in dev environments for clearing out the database or going into production web servers to flag a user as "sudo".

## API

Public docs forthcoming

## Tokens

Tokens are time-based tokens with a default life of 6 hours. API keys are permanent until revoked. 

We authenticate using HTTP basic auth, where the username is the token and the password is blank. To do this with curl, use this command: (noting that the trailing colon after the token is important because it means "no password")

``` curl -u TOKEN: https://www.staffjoy.com/api/v2/ ```

You can always get a new token for your logged-in user at [/auth/api-token](https://www.staffjoy.com/auth/api-token).

## Specs

Our API uses JSON. Response data is in the `data` field, resources on the object are given in the `resources` field, and other metadata - like `limit` or `offset` may be provided.

## Formatting 

This library uses the [Google YAPF](https://github.com/google/yapf) library to enforce PEP-8. Using it is easy - run `make fmt` to format your code inline correctly. Failure to do this will result in your build failing. You have been warned.

To disable YAPf around code that you do not want changed, wrap it like this:

```
# yapf: disable
FOO = {
    # ... some very large, complex data literal.
}

BAR = [
    # ... another large data literal.
]
# yapf: enable
```

## Miscellaneous


##  Resolving database issues

If you end up with multiple heads, do:

```
python main.py db heads
# Using the two hashes
python main.py db merge <hash1> <hash2>
```

## Other Features

* Twilio IVR
* StatusPage.io integration
* Mobile application detection via headers

## Omissions

This is not a perfect copy of our internal repo. For ease of use, sanity, and security, removed parts include:

* Billing (we used [Stripe](https://stripe.com) and [Paid Labs](https://paidlabs.com))
* Event tracking with [Intercom](http://intercom.io)
* Custom code for legacy clients
* HSTS headers - we don't want to unintentionally trigger this on test deployments, but you can uncomment the headers in the `nginx.conf`
* Dev email limits - We limited development emails to `@staffjoy.com` email addresses

## Known issues

* The development environment works, but really needs a ground-up rewrite to something like Docker Compose. (It hasn't been extensively modified since before Staffjoy was a full-time job!)
* The tests use `current_app` rather than the generator `create_app`. This should be corrected.
* The session management system, when reading a session from a cookie, recreates the session. This means that the list of active sessions is longer than expected (though still secure).
